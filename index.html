      I have seen way too many Minehut servers (including popular ones) make so many mistakes that cause them to be

      inactive, have low player retention, or just be really rushed and low quality overall. In this list, it sort of

      tells a lesson on what to do to actually make a good server. Nowadays, Minehut has gotten more and more

      low-quality servers over the years and it's time to fix that. </p>

    <h2 id="dont">Don'ts</h2>

    <p>I am going to start out with this section, because it is the most important, since almost everything in this list

      is not followed by in most MH servers</p>

    <ul class="list-container">

      <li><b>DON'T</b> make a Box server <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Those types of servers are oversaturated, and too repetitive. I don\'t see a good reason to make one since I think the idea is dumb.')">Why?</button>

      </li>

      <li><b>DON'T</b> make a Gens server <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Those types of servers are oversaturated like the Box servers, and too repetitive. I don\'t see a good reason to make one since I think the idea is dumb.')">Why?</button>

      </li>

      <li><b>DON'T</b> make a Anarchy server <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Minehut Anarchy servers are normally found cringe by the community, and the server dies after less than a month. ')">Why?</button>

      </li>

      <li><b>DON'T</b> make your server repetitive <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Make your server unique, you can get inspiration from other people\'s servers, but don\'t copy it.')">Why?</button>

      </li>

      <li><b>DON'T</b> make your server <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win">P2W</a></b> <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Monetization is fine, but if you\'re charging money for an advantage over other players, then there\'s a problem. If you are afraid that your server is P2W, have some people check it or remove anything that gives an advantage. (The only exception to this is cosmetics, cosmetics are fine.)')">Why?</button>

      </li>

      <li><b>DON'T</b> use MH server templates <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Server templates often cause repitive and overall low-quality servers 99% of the time. You can make a unique server without them.')">Why?</button>

      </li>

      <li><b>DON'T</b> use a paid plan on MH <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Their paid plans are somewhat very expensive and sometimes time consuming to get on (I\'m talking to you Daily plan) The only paid plan that is feasible to get by voting is MH20, but it takes an entire month of voting straight to get that for free. If you want to switch to a better server, use server hosts like OrbitNode, ElixirNode or PebbleHost that offer cheap and powerful servers that also offer more features. ')">Why?</button>

      </li>

       <li><b>DON'T</b> rig your server's crates <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('If you do have false chances, it might cause players to be there for longer (if your server is godforstakenly p2w, which it shouldn\'t be especially on MH) and it decreases peoples trust and your server\'s transparency.')">Why?</button>

      </li>

       <li><b>DON'T</b> hire random people as staff, mods or admins <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Most younger people don\'t realize that there are bad actors out there looking to ruin people\'s experiences. Most of the time, there are people in MH lobby chat that ask if anyone needs admins, If this \'staff kiddie\' does get a server that needs staff and sucessfully gets the rank, a few days later the \'staff kiddie\' starts ruining the server and that is regular behavior. This is the reason why you need to have an application and start out with a weaker-powered rank and not trust everyone on the internet.')">Why?</button>

      </li>

     

     <li><b>DON'T</b> share your account or let anyone access your server console. <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Some scammers on the MH market advertise theirselves as professional builders are skripters, and sometimes if you contact these scammers and you pay them to do whatever service, they will either charge a bunch, leave and block you, or ask you to give your server console or \/op them.')">Why?</button>

      </li>

      <li><b>DON'T</b> have spammy ads on MH's Discord server.  <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Simple, if you have spammy or repetitive ads, you won\'t get players. Talk about what makes your server unique, or what you plan to add. This doesn\'t apply on \/ad since random people join servers in the MH lobby due to boredom.')">Why?</button>

         <li><b>DON'T</b> DM random people on MH's Discord Server  <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Good way to get banned. An easy way to get people to do services for you is #offers-and-requests and #server-ads')">Why?</button>

      </li>

      <li><b>DON'T</b> punish people for silly reasons.  <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Good way to make your server lose 90% of your players and retention.')">Why?</button>

      </li>

    </ul>

     <h2 id="do">Do's</h2>

    <p>This is what I reccommend to do to have a great server!

    

    <ul  class="list-container">

       <li><b>DO</b> expand outside of Minehut <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Good servers can exist outside of Minehut. Minehut is now a sewer of poorly created and low quality servers. Although expanding outside requires a few dollars a month, You can manage it, and you get better features. ')">Why?</button>

      </li>

        <li><b>DO</b> use the External server plan <sub>(when it actually becomes easy to use)</sub> <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Good servers can exist outside of Minehut (again). And if you have a server hosted outside Minehut and connect it to Minehut via the External Server plan, you can get a lot of players if you play your cards right. (metaphorically) ')">Why?</button>

        </li>

       <li><b>DO</b> make your server <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play">free to play</a></b> <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Monetization is fine, but if you are giving an advantage over other people with real life money, then you are violation Minecraft\'s TOS. Cosmetics are fine on your server, as long as everything on your store can be obtained without spending a cent (even if it\'s harder to get without paying), then your server is free to play. ')">Why?</button>

         

      </li>

        <li><b>Play your cards right</b> <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('You can make a great server with no experience, you just have to play your cards right. Everything in this site tells you what to do and not do when making a great, fair and entertaining server!')">How/Why?</button>

          

      </li>

      <li><b>DO</b> have unique gamemodes <button class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm"

          onclick="alert('Minehut is full of boring, and repetitive servers that go dead after a few months, If you come up with original ideas and gamemodes, you can potentially have a great server/gamemode!')">How/Why?</button>
